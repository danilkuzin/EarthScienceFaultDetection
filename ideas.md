1. Use generative models to generate more training examples (according to Goodfellow can try an ensemble of generative models for that)
2. Check out line detection in the lane detection [paper](https://github.com/cardwing/Codes-for-Lane-Detection#SCNN-Tensorflow)
3. Try dense prediction. Check out details in Practical_DL week-5 seminar (at home computer there is a solution)
