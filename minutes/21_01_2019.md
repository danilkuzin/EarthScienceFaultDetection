Initial meeting with earth scientists

### Data
* tiff or jpeg format
* 100 x 100 km
* data of 300 faults and 300 nonfaults
* Marked lines of faults and lookalikes (answer maybe is expected?)
* RGB satellite images, heights map, ground truth images, later - derivatives (think about format)

### Domain
* focus on vertical normal faults in Tibet
* river valleys usually terminate at fault
* river valleys go from wide to narrow closer to fault
* fault valley is asymmetrical compared to river valley
