In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2017 (pp. 5725-5733) - claim that they are the first to have impainting of line drawings. Not exactly, our case, but maybe used in the part of what we suggested to add in the previous email - kind of postprocessing of CNN detections to form a line. In this sense raw CNN detections are lines with gaps and we need to impaint those gaps, and this is not a trivial task according to this paper. http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sasaki_Joint_Gap_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html

Computer vision-based framework for extracting geological lineaments from optical remote sensing data. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.02320. 2018 - claim that linear "features" (lines) are difficult to extract in geological context. They extract geological lineaments - as far as I got this is any lines, including faults but I am not sure that these are the same faults as ours. Moreover, in their claim that linear features are difficult to extract they refer to the paper from 1993. They also use "classical" computer vision methods such as Canny edge detector.  https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02320
